# 🌍 World Bank Commander (WBC)
WBC is a dashboard of world bank indicators displayed on a 2x2 grid.
You can reach WBC here: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator

Simplicity was my goal. I wanted different indicators of various countries shown
in an overview to explore relations not normally considered. Something like illegal mining and drug trade in neighbouring countries, for example.

The indicators are fetched using the [wbgapi](https://pypi.org/project/wbgapi/) python library.
Graphs are build with [plotly.graph_objects](https://plotly.com/python/).

I've considered rebuilding it with html and D3 charts to address long indicator names, legends and spacing.
